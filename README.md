2. I recently set up my GitHub account for a college course, and I'm new to using it. I'm looking forward to learning how to manage my code and collaborate with others. It's exciting to see how GitHub can help with my projects and improve my skills.

3. I created a repository named "README" as part of a lab for my college course. This repository contains basic information about my account and serves as a practice space for learning how to use GitHub.
